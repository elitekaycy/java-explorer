Common Meta-Annotations

    @Retention:
        Specifies how long the annotation is retained.
        Values: SOURCE, CLASS, RUNTIME.

    @Target:
        Specifies where the annotation can be applied.
        Values: FIELD, METHOD, PARAMETER, CONSTRUCTOR, TYPE.

    @Documented:
        Indicates the annotation should be included in JavaDocs.

    @Inherited:
        Allows subclasses to inherit the annotation.

Practical Use Cases

    Logging and Profiling:
        Use annotations like @LogExecutionTime to profile method performance.
    Validation:
        Implement annotations like @NotEmpty or @MinLength for input validation.
    Dependency Injection:
        Frameworks like Spring use annotations (@Autowired, @Qualifier) for dependency injection.
    Custom Serialization:
        Annotations like @JsonField to map Java fields to specific JSON keys.

Summary

Custom annotations provide a powerful way to add metadata to your Java code and enable reusable behaviors through reflection or AOP. By combining them with meta-annotations, you can fine-tune their behavior and scope to fit specific use cases.
