What i want to achieve


./jcurl <url>  should make a get request and display everything from the header to payload data

./jcurl <Keyword> GET|POST|DELETE

extras should be flags < -h | ...>  
read content type header | default should be plain text
----> use json and html and text plain for now
    ---> prereq
     --> json convertor

>  read content as stream and write to output
