# Java Explorer

In this repository, I explore computer science and programming concepts through Java.  
The goal is to deepen understanding of core concepts and create practical implementations that mirror real-world systems.

## Topics I will cover or atleast hope to gradually

### 1. Systems Design Concepts
- [Building a caching layer (e.g., LRU Cache, Write-through Cache)](./build-your-own-simple-cache/)
- [Building Redis from scratch](./build-your-own-redis/)
- [Build your own json parser](./build-your-own-json-parser/)
- Designing scalable and distributed systems

### 2. Databases and Query Processing
- Implementing a SQL-like query engine
- Understanding and building indexes
- Exploring database transactions and consistency models

### 3. Networking and Protocols
- Building a basic HTTP server
- Implementing a custom TCP client and server
- Simulating load balancers and reverse proxies

### 4. Concurrency and Multithreading
- Writing thread-safe code
- Implementing custom thread pools
- Exploring locks, semaphores, and other synchronization tools

### 5. Low-Level Programming
- Parsing and handling custom file formats
- Writing efficient memory management routines
- Exploring bytecode manipulation with Java

### 6. Framework and Library Development
- Creating reusable frameworks for common tasks
- Experimenting with annotations and reflection
- Designing modular and pluggable architectures

## Why This Project?  
This repository is an educational journey to:
- Reinforce Java skills through hands-on projects.
- Understand the "why" behind various technologies and paradigms.
- Prepare for real-world scenarios by building foundational components.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and explore the individual directories for each topic. Each folder contains:
- **Code Samples:** Well-documented Java implementations.
- **ReadMe Files:** Descriptions and instructions for each concept.
- **Test Cases:** Unit and integration tests to ensure correctness.

Feel free to fork the repo, contribute, or use it as a reference in your learning journey!
